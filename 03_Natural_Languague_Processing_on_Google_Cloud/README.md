### [Course Introduction & NLP on Google Cloud](./Week1/README.md)
This module addresses the reasons to learn NLP from Google and provides an overview of the course structure and goals.

### [NLP with Vertex AI](./Week2/README.md)
This module explores AutoML and custom training, which are the two options to develop an NLP project with Vertex AI. Additionally, the module introduces an end-to-end NLP workflow and provides a hands-on lab to apply the workflow to solve a task of text classification with AutoML.

### [Text Representation](./Week3/README.md)
This module describes the process to prepare text data in NLP and introduces the major categories of text representation techniques.

### [NLP Models](./Week4/README.md)
This module describes different NLP models including ANN, DNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. It also introduces the benefits and disadvantages of each model.

### [Advanced NLP Models](./Week5/README.md)
This module introduces the state-of-the-art technologies and models in NLP: encoder-decoder, attention mechanism, transformers, BERT, and large language models.

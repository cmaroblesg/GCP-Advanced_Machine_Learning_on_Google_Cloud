# NLP with Vertex AI
This module explores AutoML and custom training, which are the two options to develop an NLP project with Vertex AI. Additionally, the module introduces an end-to-end NLP workflow and provides a hands-on lab to apply the workflow to solve a task of text classification with AutoML.

## Learning Objectives
* Recognize the two options to develop NLP models with Vertex AI: AutoML and custom training.
* Build an end-to-end NLP pipeline by using AutoML.
